          Problem Statement
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Sri Lankan tea industry is in decline due to economic instability,
          fertilizer shortages, and ineffective disease management.
          Smallholders, lacking proper guidance, often choose unsuitable tea
          varieties and outdated practices, leading to reduced yield and
          quality, further weakening the countryâ€™s position against global
          competitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the export potential, small-scale tea producers rarely explore
          international markets due to limited awareness and support. If guided
          to identify high-demand regions and revenue drivers, they can
          significantly enhance exports and contribute to national economic
          recovery. But there is little interest from producers and policymakers
          in this opportunity.
